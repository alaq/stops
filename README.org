* stops
Stops is an iOS and Android app that let's you choose a destination and notifies when you've reached it. You can use Stops to wake you up from a nap on your way to work or help you get to a destination which you have never commuted to. The app uses geofencing and background geolocation only when you're in transit. It also plays well with Google Maps and Apple Maps.
